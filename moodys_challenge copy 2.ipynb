    "Above you followed specific steps and used simulated annealing as well as quantum or quantum-inspired methods to solve the problem of interest. To do this, you were instructed to incorporate the constraints of the problem (equalities/inequalities) in the objective function and then to find the QUBO formulation of the problem in question. In this exercise you are asked to think of another way to solve the **Mean-Variance-VaR Simplified Version** problem with quantum, quantum-inspired or hybrid methods, without following any of the steps mentioned in this challenge."

    "Imagine that you are part of the Quantum team at Moody's. You are meeting the board of stakeholders of an important company in the US. Given what you now know about the current quantum hardware capabilities, in which quantum algorithms should the stakeholders invest and why? Prepare your pitch focusing only on portfolio optimization problems. How do you think quantum could potentially avoid the drawbacks of classical optimization algorithms and why should a company invest in quantum today?"
